			<h1> The first chapter <h6> Sunday, August 5, 2018, 1900 hrs</h6> </h1>
			I am going to have a mid year resolution. For years i have tried to sideline web development because
			... yada yada yada .... HTML IS NOT A PRORAMMING LANGUAGE. hhahahaha . I never even gave a thougtht 
			about web development or javascript. Yeah javascript, because you know all cool kids hate javascipt. 
			I tried runnning the same bandwagon for many years, starting in early 2000s. I starting learning
			programming with acionscipt, yet my puny brain couldn't even think about learning html decently. Years
			passed and (fingers crossed) I made a pact to learn every cool language I could think of. And I started
			with ... (drumrolls ) C and then C++ . Yeah I know, I know, I should have made a thoughful decision 
			before I would have jumped ship. But anyways, here I am and within a course of next 5 weeks I will make
			necessary preparation to call myself a webdev (better than mediocre, fingers closed). So adios for now,
			I will be back tomorrow to show something new that I have learnt. Good bye.
