summary: I decided to change my usual pattern of writing blog to something more automated and easier

hello, its really been a long time.  
My exam has just completed so I  will try to continue my writing at faster pace to reach my target. 
I'm planning to switch to static website generator written in jinja2 and content in markdown format
I hope it will make my task easier. 
I'll be here soon. 
bye!!
