summary: I decided to change my usual pattern of writing blog to something more automated and easier

##hello, after a long time ###
I've just completed my exam and I will continue my journey 
to writing my blog.

This time I'm planning to switch to static web site generator 
that generate a web page from a template with content written
in an .md file.

I hope it will create my journey easier.

I'll reach you soon.
